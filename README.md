Bootcamp: UPENN-VIRT-DATA-PT-06-2023-U-LOLC-MTTH Module 3 Challenge: Python Challenge

## Description
This project contains two analyses, PyBank and PyPoll.
These run separately but are launched from the main directory so CSV files read in and analysis files are outputted correctly.

## Instructions
This script was tested on Python 3.10, as set up by Anaconda.
It requires importing `os` and `cvs`, which are standard Python modules.

Run each analysis by entering the command `python PyBank/main.py` and `python PyPoll/main.py` respectively from the main directory.

## Usage
This challenge runs two separate analyses.
There are no dependencies between PyBank and PyPoll.

Both analyses read in a CSV stored in the `Resources` directory of their respective project directories.
An output file is generated in the `analysis` folder of each analysis.

PyBank looks at Profit and Loss data.
It presents the changes in P&L and notes the greatest increase and decrease along with the month in which the change occurred.

PyPoll looks at election data for three candidates.
It presents the candidates along with their vote totals and identifies the winner of the election.

The result files are included with this repo.

## Credits
Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
